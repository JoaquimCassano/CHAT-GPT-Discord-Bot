## _A Discord bot written in python what integrates ChatGPT and Discord_



## Installation

First install the required libraries with the requirements.txt File.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Editing main.py file

First, in the line 15, we need to put our OpenAI API Key
For this, open the site https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys, log in (or create a OpenAI account) and click in Create new secret key
(https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Assuming you've already created a discord bot, in line 32, change TOKEN to your bot's token

## Editing keep_alive.py 
Here, you only need to change the port in the line 13.
And now, we are ready!
